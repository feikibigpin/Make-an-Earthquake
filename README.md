The aim of the project is to make the user have the experience of the powerful of an earthquake by shaking his/her device in order to reproduce the energy of it, letting the user get awareness about the exponential energy of an earthquake, visualizing this fact by this app and giving facts of how big is the change between an earthquake of magnitude 8 and another of magnitude 8.5 (for example).

As the app starts, after generating your own earthquake and let you see the representation of the energy, it´s possible to discover an example of a real earthquake of the magnitude generated, showing its magnitude and what it had caused/effected.

The main challenge was about the brief because it requested an "out of scale" interpretation of the selected theme, and considering that we are not experts on the matter of coding, we had to think simplier to apply the things we learn in the course but still, achiving something big. 

At the beginning we have searched for a visualization that could suit our theme, so we have defined a moodboard and collected some ispirational contents from the Web.

After we found a graphical sinthesis and made some mock ups, we tried to repropose it with p5.js.

Even though it was simplier than our first idea, the main difficulties of the project were about the interaction part related to the movements  of the user(the shaking part) and the response of the device counting its acceleration value; but also the visualization of an earthquake effect and of the quantity of energy accumulated, then the addition of the images depending the magnitude that the app store for its shaking, and so on…so basically, the entire project.

We found some tutorials that were useful for us to reproduce the earthquake effect. 

For the coding part we have considered the following link:

and the official website of p5.js, in the "Examples" part about "Array of Object":
